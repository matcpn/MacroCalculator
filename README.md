# MacroCalculator
major features I'd like to add before release:
some kind of better macro visualization - pretty vague but i want to give users a guideline of what their diets should look like in terms of macros, but emphasize calories to change body weight
a user profile with actual person stats and calculations
more customizable settings (get rid of the permanent notification for example)
complete overhaul of UI to look like an actual app and not a website made by a 4 yr old
rewrite a lot of code

minor features:
remove items from the food menu and consumed food list
add more calorie counter images

bug fixes:
make a better nav bar
get rid of that dumb "are you sure" screen
fix the images for the calorie counter so that they're centered
