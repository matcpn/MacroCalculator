# MacroCalculator
major features I'd like to add before release:
<br>1. some kind of better macro visualization - pretty vague but i want to give users a guideline of what their diets should look like in terms of macros, but emphasize calories to change body weight
<br>2. a user profile with actual person stats and calculations
<br>3. more customizable settings (get rid of the permanent notification for example)
<br>4. complete overhaul of UI to look like an actual app and not a website made by a 4 yr old
<br>5. rewrite a lot of code
<br>6. A simplistic way to log exercise, displayed in a user friendly way (e.g. somthing like a "get more calories" button, lets you log exercise and your calories remaining on the day go back up)
<br>7. Get the government food database working so that you can quickly add foods to the food menu

minor features:
<br>1. remove items from the food menu and consumed food list
<br>2. add more calorie counter images

bug fixes:
<br>1. make a better nav bar
<br>2. get rid of that dumb "are you sure" screen
<br>3. fix the images for the calorie counter so that they're centered
<br>4. fix the icon when you look in notification bar to show correct number
<br>5. fix it so that licking the notification launches the app

crazy ideas that I dont even know if they're possible:
<br> 1.S Health/fitbit/pedometer integration??
<br> 2. a user driven food database similar to mfp??
