# MacroCalculator
major features I'd like to add before release:
<br>1. some kind of better macro visualization - pretty vague but i want to give users a guideline of what their diets should look like in terms of macros, but emphasize calories to change body weight
<br>2. a user profile with actual person stats and calculations
<br>3. more customizable settings (get rid of the permanent notification for example)
<br>4. complete overhaul of UI to look like an actual app and not a website made by a 4 yr old
<br>5. rewrite a lot of code
<br>6. A simplistic way to log exercise, displayed in a user friendly way (e.g. somthing like a "get more calories" button, lets you log exercise and your calories remaining on the day go back up)
<br>7. Get the government food database working so that you can quickly add foods to the food menu
<br>8. Decouple the ConsumedList database from the food menu database so that I can clear my food menu without losing my foods in my consumed list
<br>9. Sort food list by most recently used
<br>10. periodically ping you to update weight (1ce a week?)
<br>11. make a better nav bar

minor features:
~~<br>1. ability to remove items from the food menu and consumed food list~~
<br>2. add more calorie counter images - ie make it so you can go past 3k calories remaining
~~<br>3. add a confirm box to delete all consumed and delete single consumed~~

bug fixes:
~~<br>1. get rid of that dumb "are you sure" screen~~
<br>2. fix the images for the calorie counter so that they're centered
<br>3. fix the icon when you look in notification menu to show correct number
<br>4. fix it so that clicking the notification launches the app
<br>5. got a weird bug somehow when adding item to the consumed food menu -  might be fixed by #8 in major features
~~<br>6, fix the calorie counter number to round rather than truncate~~
<br>7. fix the clear list consumed foods option to only clea rthe list for today rather than all of history

crazy ideas that I dont even know if they're possible:
<br> 1.S Health/fitbit/pedometer integration?? Maybe even roll my own pedometer??
<br> 2. a user driven food database similar to mfp??
<br> 3. macro/calorie analyzer and food suggester
<br> 4. graphs and data and shit for past days
